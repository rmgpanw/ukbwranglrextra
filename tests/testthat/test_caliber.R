# Check codes exist -------------------------------------------------------

## e.g. 4+ character ICD10 codes in ALT code format (majority of codes are in ICD10 code format)

# Undivided 3 character ICD10 codes (e.g. A38, Scarlet fever) -------------



# 3 character ICD10 codes that need expanding -----------------------------

# For CALIBER, where only the parent 3 characters are shown then it implies that
# all the children codes fall under the same disease category. These need
# expanding to include all children codes.

## ICD10 codes with modifiers (e.g. E10, M79.7) --------------------------



## Check 3 character ICD10 codes without modifiers are expanded (e.g.  D25, leiomyoma) --------



# Codes that are duplicated within (and between?) diseases ----------------
